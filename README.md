## Getting Started
To get started with the Simple Arkitekter Theme, simply download the latest release from the GitHub repository and extract it to your WordPress themes directory. You can then activate the theme from the WordPress admin panel.

Once the theme is activated, you can begin customizing it to suit your needs. The theme comes with a customizable homepage layout that you can configure from the WordPress Customizer. You can also customize the theme's colors and fonts from the Customizer.

## Customizing the Theme
To further customize the Simple Arkitekter Theme, you can edit the theme files directly or create a child theme. Creating a child theme is recommended, as it allows you to make changes to the theme without modifying the original files.

To create a child theme, simply create a new directory in your WordPress themes directory with the name of your child theme. In this directory, create a file called style.css and add the following code:

```/*
 Theme Name:   My Child Theme
 Template:     simple-arkitekter-theme
*/ ```

Replace "My Child Theme" with the name of your child theme, and "simple-arkitekter-theme" with the name of the Simple Arkitekter Theme directory.

You can then add any custom CSS, PHP, or JavaScript files to your child theme directory to override the corresponding files in the parent theme.
